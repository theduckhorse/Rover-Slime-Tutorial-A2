# Mapping & Navigation

## Demonstration Video

## Movement
## Shortest Path Algorithm
## Testing
Our group had tested that the mapping and navigation algorithm vigorously to ensure that the algorithm is working.

For black box testing, the algo was tested on its map generation, the map generation is done by making the 
The result of blackbox can be seen from the demo video as well as the results of the test case are shown as follows:

For whitebox testing, the algo was tested on its shortest path generation using the A* algorithm.

The image below shows an example console output during our whitebox testing
