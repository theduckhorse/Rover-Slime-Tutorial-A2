### Ultrasonic

<b>How the ultrasonic work? </b> <br />
The ultrasonic work by supplying a short 10 microseconds pulse to trigger the input to start the ranging, and then the module will send a short 8 cycle burst of ultrasonic and raises it echo. If the 8 cycle burst are reflected back, the echo pin goes low as soon as the signal is received. This generates a pulse on the echo pin whose width varies from 150 Âµs to 25 ms depending on the time taken to receive the signal.The calculation of the distance is using the time interval between sending trigger signal and receiving the echo signal. From there, the team decided to use the Formula: <b>uS / 58 = centimeters</b> which will get you the distance.

### Accelerometer

<b>How the Accelerometer work? </b> <br />
The accelerometer sends data to the Raspberry Pi Pico using the I2C communication protocol. The communication begins when the Pico (Master) sends a start bit followed by the accelerometer's (slave) address and write request. The master waits for the slave's acknowledgement before sending the register address. It then waits for another acknowledge before sending a stop bit. Afterwards, the master will send another start bit followed by the slave's register address and a read request. The slave will begin transmitting data till it receives the NACK from master and the stop bit. 12 registers are read from the acclerometer. 6 registers are for the acceleration values (x, y, z) and 6 registers are for the gyroscope values (x, y, z).
